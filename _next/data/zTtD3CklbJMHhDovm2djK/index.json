At the same time, most developers don’t consider themselves to be security experts. While most of us are doing our best, it’s difficult to know what we’re missing or what our blindspots are. Luckily enough, you don’t have to be a security expert to follow a systematic approach to security.</p> <p>In this talk, I will introduce you to the OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model, a comprehensive framework that you can use to assess the maturity of your current approach to security. It also provides you with clear steps that you can take to improve your approach to security. My main focus will be on the dimensions in the model that are directly relevant to developers and I will give you a few examples of practices that you can start implementing today!</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false,"featured_photo":{"id":512042792,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/8/highres_512042792.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/8/600_512042792.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/a/e/8/thumb_512042792.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}},{"created":1681833264000,"duration":7200000,"id":"292976982","name":"Style your React apps without stress!","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1685028600000,"local_date":"2023-05-25","local_time":"17:30","updated":1685040866000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":2,"venue":{"id":24315864,"name":"Ordina HQ ","lat":52.05641174316406,"lon":5.110540866851807,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Ringwade 1","city":"Nieuwegein","country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands"},"is_online_event":false,"eventType":"PHYSICAL","group":{"created":1465915067000,"name":"Codestar Night","id":20072875,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"Codestar-Night","who":"Codestars","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/codestar-night/events/292976982/","description":"<p>Traditionally, dynamic styling has always been a controversial topic for many JavaScript/Frontend developers.

With Styled components this is now possible within the React ecosystem and in this video series I will introduce the main concepts to get started. I will cover:</p> <p>1. Setting up styled components<br/>2. Converting traditional CSS in Styled Components.<br/>3. Set up Theming with Typescript.<br/>4. Adding global styles<br/>5. Extending styles and more…</p> <p>If you have ever worries how to so custom SaaS styling or how to easily implement a dark mode, this meetup is for you! We will dive in the How and why we would use Styled Components. It’s an OPTIONAL code-along workshop with ample opportunities to ask for questions and best practises. Within 2 hours we will cover the goals listed above and once you leave the room, you will be able to setup and use Styled Components in your own projects. that’s a promise!

That we should be posting to our own site and building ourselves up. You can, of course, use off-the-shelf applications to do that for you.</p> <p>Or… You can use it as an exercise to try something new and learn new skills!</p> <p>In this session, we will look at doing just that! Starting with an empty GitHub repository we are going to make a Blazor WebAssembly application to act as our website. We’ll connect that to an Azure Function that reads posts from a CosmosDB to pass to that site. Then we’ll deploy that to a production Azure Static Web App.</p> <p>Of course, when developing an application, it’s useful to be able to run it locally. So, we’ll also look at how we can do that with Azure Static Web Apps.</p> <p>Finally, in order to be able to write new blog posts, we need to be able to authenticate ourselves and provide proper authorization so that this functionality can be added later.</p> <p>**About Stacy**</p> <p>Speaker, author, and software developer. Stacy has been developing solutions since the mid-1990s in various companies and industries ranging from facilitating contract jobbing to allowing consumers to close a mortgage without the help of a financial adviser – with lots in between.</p> <p>She has a passion for sharing knowledge: using storytelling for sharing her experiences to help teams grow in the ways that they develop software and work together and performing live coding demonstrations to inspire others to try new technologies.</p> <p>Stacy has just published her first book, aimed at helping developers get started building dynamic applications using C#, Azure Functions, and Azure Static Web Apps.</p> <p>For her effort in the community, Stacy has been awarded the Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies since 2020.</p> <p>**Programme**</p> <p>17:30 Walk in<br/>18:00 Dinner<br/>18:45 Talk part 1<br/>19:25 Break<br/>19:40 Talk part 2 + Q&amp;A<br/>20:20 Drinks</p> ","visibility":"public","member_pay_fee":false,"featured_photo":{"id":507692611,"highres_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/6/3/highres_507692611.jpeg","photo_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/6/3/600_507692611.jpeg","thumb_link":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/7/f/6/3/thumb_507692611.jpeg","type":"event","base_url":"https://secure.meetupstatic.com"}},{"created":1658125967000,"duration":7200000,"id":"287258312","name":"DENGUG","rsvp_limit":12,"date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1663257600000,"local_date":"2022-09-15","local_time":"18:00","updated":1663268499000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":3,"venue":{"id":24315864,"name":"Ordina HQ ","lat":52.05641174316406,"lon":5.110540866851807,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Ringwade 1","city":"Nieuwegein","country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands"},"is_online_event":false,"eventType":"PHYSICAL","group":{"created":1465915067000,"name":"Codestar Night","id":20072875,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"Codestar-Night","who":"Codestars","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/codestar-night/events/287258312/","description":"<p>Dutch Enterprise Angular User Group meeting, discussing experiences and issues when working with the Angular Ecosystem in enterprise environments.</p> <p>Representatives with enterprise experience from several companies are invited.</p> <p>Core topics include:</p> <p>* Nx monorepos<br/>* NgRx state management, SHARI and DUGSA principles<br/>* Testing</p> <p>Places are limited, that's why contact information is required.

He searches for new knowledge in other people, books, experiences, videos and practicing. When he learnes something new he is exited to pass it on to everybody who wants to know.</p> <p>I always thought that my code was fine. I took my time for naming things, wrote small classes/methods and tried to use other Clean Code practices. But after a job interview with a technical coach, I was pointed towards Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and some other design topics. I could learn a lot from it, said the technical coach. And I did! Since then, I started noticing how much parts of DDD could help with my day to day job. I will take you with me on my learning journey of Domain-Driven Design, and how it helped me improve my code. We will touch upon themes like Ubiquitous Language, Supple Design, Bounded Contexts and more.
