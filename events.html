While you acknowledge the value of automated testing, you also recognise that not all tests can be automated due to their complexity or cost. Additionally, you have noticed that pre-conceived tests are not always comprehensive enough to identify unforeseen issues that arise in production.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may wonder how it&#x27;s possible to include unforeseen issues in pre-conceived tests. And that&#x27;s where this workshop comes in! We will introduce you to Session Based Testing, which can help you become more creative and identify potential issues before they cause problems in production. The workshop will teach you the principles of Exploratory Testing using heuristics, mnemonics, and tours. You will also learn how to apply focus to your testing efforts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of the workshop, you will receive cheat sheets and charter ideas to help you implement Exploratory Testing within your organisation and improve the quality of your software. Together, we will explore how to use this approach to identify and address potential issues, even those that may not have been considered in advance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Key Learnings:&lt;br/&gt;\* What is Exploratory Testing&lt;br/&gt;\* How you can use ET in your day to day practice&lt;br/&gt;\* Helpful cheatsheets and templates&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to bring your laptop as it will be a hands on workshop!

So let&#x27;s start incorporating costs into our cloud design to make the best performance solution and the most economical solution!&lt;br/&gt;In 2022 we see that security by design is common sense, why not incorporate the financial aspect.&lt;br/&gt;In this session we will share our thoughts on maintaining grip on your cloud bill &amp;amp; maintaining high performance. By incorporating our four pillars of economic cloud design you are able to design cost efficient and high performant cloud solutions.&lt;br/&gt;We will of course also explain &quot;Zero User Costs&quot; and &quot;Geo Efficiency&quot; so you can start today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Sebastiaan Zeeff - Get Started With Security: An introduction for developers**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most developers will agree that security is an important consideration in modern software development projects. At the same time, most developers don’t consider themselves to be security experts. While most of us are doing our best, it’s difficult to know what we’re missing or what our blindspots are. Luckily enough, you don’t have to be a security expert to follow a systematic approach to security.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will introduce you to the OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model, a comprehensive framework that you can use to assess the maturity of your current approach to security. It also provides you with clear steps that you can take to improve your approach to security. My main focus will be on the dimensions in the model that are directly relevant to developers and I will give you a few examples of practices that you can start implementing today!&lt;/p&gt; </p></section><section><h2>Style your React apps without stress!</h2><p>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, dynamic styling has always been a controversial topic for many JavaScript/Frontend developers. CSS Custom properties have given us many ways to improve this, however how would it feel to have the full versatile power of a programming language within CSS? With Styled components this is now possible within the React ecosystem and in this video series I will introduce the main concepts to get started. I will cover:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. Setting up styled components&lt;br/&gt;2. Converting traditional CSS in Styled Components.&lt;br/&gt;3. Set up Theming with Typescript.&lt;br/&gt;4. Adding global styles&lt;br/&gt;5. Extending styles and more…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have ever worries how to so custom SaaS styling or how to easily implement a dark mode, this meetup is for you! We will dive in the How and why we would use Styled Components. It’s an OPTIONAL code-along workshop with ample opportunities to ask for questions and best practises. Within 2 hours we will cover the goals listed above and once you leave the room, you will be able to setup and use Styled Components in your own projects. that’s a promise! Who is Rodney Wormsbecher&lt;br/&gt;Rodney is a senior frontend developer who’s been involved in numerous big and small web projects within the Netherlands. Over the past 3 years he has used Styled Components extensively for frontend applications and style libraries.

And that's where this workshop comes in! We will introduce you to Session Based Testing, which can help you become more creative and identify potential issues before they cause problems in production.
