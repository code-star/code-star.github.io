Many enterprises use a mix of opensource and cloud-based software to power these AI initiatives. Data scientists need an environment that enables them to design, build, train, test and deploy their workloads without the worry of thinking about cloud infrastructure. RedHat Openshift AI is a platform that can be used for building training, testing and deploying models optimized for hybrid cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Join us for this introduction session led by an expert from Red Hat who will take us into the world of AI/ML and the OpenShift AI platform. The session will consist of three parts. The first part is a generic introduction for everyone who wants to know more about AI/ML, the OpenShift AI platform, its usecases, benefits and things you need to consider (like compliancy).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second part of the session will cover what it means to build an &#x27;Intelligent application&#x27; and how OpenShift AI can help you to support the full lifecycle and bring AI-enabled apps faster to production in a managed way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The session will be concluded with a demo of the Openshift AI platform and some drinks and bites.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**When**: March 14th 2024 at 15:00-18:00&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Where**: Ringwade 1, Ordina Nieuwegein&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Who**: Data Scientists, AI/ML/cloud/DevOps/Cloud Engineers, everyone interested in AI/ML and OpenShift AI.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don&#x27;t miss this chance to elevate your technical expertise and reserve your spot now for our upcoming workshop Red Hat OpenShift AI Platform on 14 March and get up to speed in the world of modern application development and operations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make sure you register for this meetup via the link below.

Ansible Lightspeed (including IBM Watson Code Assistant) is a generative AI tool which makes it easier for developers to automate tasks in Ansible playbooks and create Ansible content. This session led by a Red Hat instructor is themed around &quot;A day in the life of an (Ansible) software developer&quot; and is focusing on tools that can help developers to create and improve Ansible playbooks in an efficient way.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Agenda**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;* 14:30 - 15:00: Registration&lt;br/&gt;* 15:00 - 16:00: A day in the life of an Ansible developer&lt;br/&gt;* 16:00 - 18:15: Labs&lt;br/&gt;* 18:15- 18:30: Closure&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**When** : November 30th 2023 van 15:00-19:00&lt;br/&gt;**Where** : Ringwade 1, Nieuwegein&lt;br/&gt;**Who** : Software developers, Cloud Engineers and DevOps Engineers&lt;br/&gt;**What** : Bring your own laptop.&lt;/p&gt; </p></section><section><h2>Codesmiths Unite </h2><p>&lt;p&gt;**Details**&lt;br/&gt;Ordina Codesmiths stand for a shared passion in Software Engineering and knowledge sharing.&lt;br/&gt;Join us on the 23rd of November and meet your peer developers and hear interesting learnings on topics as Cloud, Security, Frontend, Mobile and testing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Program:**&lt;br/&gt;**Walk in 17:00**&lt;br/&gt;**Buffet and drinks 17:15**&lt;br/&gt;**Opening 18:00**&lt;br/&gt;**Talk 1 18:10 - 18:35**&lt;br/&gt;Frederieke Scheper - Kubernetes deployment done right&lt;br/&gt;**Talk 2 18:40 - 19:05**&lt;br/&gt;Rick Hutten - Simplifying Concurrency&lt;br/&gt;**Break**&lt;br/&gt;**Talk 3 19:20 - 19:45**&lt;br/&gt;Kaya Weers - Design patterns&lt;br/&gt;**Drinks 19:45**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**About the talks and presenters**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Frederieke Scheper**&lt;br/&gt;**Helm - Kubernetes deployments done right**&lt;br/&gt;Instead of steering into the murky waters of unmaintainable copy-pasted Kubernetes YAML files, let’s take the Helm and let it manage all your Kubernetes deployments, from a simple Spring Boot microservice to the most complex Kubernetes application! In this presentation, I will show you how easy it is to create, version, share, and publish Helm Charts. So, start using Helm and stop the copy-and-pasting. Along the way, you will discover the real benefits that lay in the role it plays in streamlining your CI/CD pipelines. Helm automatically maintains a database of all the versions of your releases. So, whenever something goes wrong during deployment, rolling back to the previous version is just one command away. So, let’s take a deep dive into Helm charts, templates, and functions: Kubernetes deployments done right!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Rick Hutten**&lt;br/&gt;**Simplifying Concurrency with Project Loom: A Journey with Pizza-chef Fabio**&lt;br/&gt;Project Loom, a groundbreaking feature within OpenJDK, introduces a lightweight and versatile concurrency model for Java. Understanding concurrency can be challenging, especially for non-technical individuals and novice developers. In this session, we embark on an adventure alongside Fabio, a passionate pizza-chef facing similar challenges in his upscale restaurant as those encountered in multithreading on a CPU. We delve into concepts such as CPU threads, virtual threads, and structured concurrency, making them accessible to listeners of all proficiency levels. Attendees will not only learn to recognize the use cases of these techniques but also gain insights into how and if Project Loom can enhance their application.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Kaya Weers**&lt;br/&gt;**A design pattern goes to the supermarket**&lt;br/&gt;Everybody knows the term design patterns. Some know the patterns and correct implementation by heart. Others vaguely recognize the pattern names but don’t recall the details. This talk is intended for the latter group.&lt;br/&gt;I’ll dive into a couple of design patterns using real-life examples. What would a design pattern look like in day-to-day life? We’ll follow Bobby and Billie and discover how a design pattern would behave in a non-digital environment: the supermarket! With the help of drawings, this talk will give you a solid understanding of design patterns, so you won&#x27;t have to look them up ever again!&lt;/p&gt; </p></section><section><h2>Tech Women Connect</h2><p>&lt;p&gt;On the 23*rd* of November we are organizing the Tech Women Connect event at the Ordina office in Utrecht(Nieuwegein), it’s an inspiring gathering that celebrates and empowers women in the tech industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the last four decades, there has been increasingly more attention on the participation of women in male-dominated sectors, such as IT — another milestone to celebrate. However, women in male-dominated careers still face challenges today.&lt;br/&gt;Modern day workforces are moving in the right direction, yet many women are not experiencing the benefits. So how can individual women continue and accelerate to thrive in male-dominated industries?&lt;br/&gt;Perhaps the best approach is to ask individual women who have done it…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here’s what you can look forward to:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Valuable Insights:** *Gain priceless insights from accomplished women in tech.

You’ll probably have encountered quite a few hurdles. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. How do I build the code, do I use CJS or ESM?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;2. How do I ensure code quality?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;3. How do I actually publish an NPM package?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;4. Can the publishing of packages be automated by CI/CD?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;5. How do I provide interactive documentation like Bootstrap or Material UI?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have ever encountered or wondered about these questions this workshop is for you. We will set up a Storybook Application, unit test it, publish it via CI/CD, containerize it with Docker, publish our container to Azure Container Registry and finally publish the container to an Azure web app.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The workshop will be hosted on the 28*th* of September 17:00 - 21:00, food and drinks are included!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pre-requisites: Some experience with JavaScript. Any CI/CD experience will help but is not necessary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A github Repo will be available for reference.&lt;/p&gt; </p></section></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"pastMeetups":[{"created":1729145782000,"duration":10800000,"id":"304055908","name":"Codestar Reunion","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1732204800000,"local_date":"2024-11-21","local_time":"17:00","updated":1732223550000,"utc_offset":3600000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":20,"venue":{"id":26404459,"name":"Ringwade 1","lat":52.057823181152344,"lon":5.111423015594482,"repinned":false,"address_1":"Ringwade 1","city":"Nieuwegein","country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands"},"is_online_event":false,"eventType":"PHYSICAL","group":{"created":1465915067000,"name":"Codestar Night","id":20072875,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"Codestar-Night","who":"Codestars","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/codestar-night/events/304055908/","description":"\u003cp\u003eFor all current and former Codestar employees, we organize a reunion in true Codestar style: after an R\u0026amp;D day, with board games with Nathan and pizza.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eWe will also have a talk by Hamza about the history of Codestar and the amazing stuff he did with the logo and other designs.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eDon't forget to wear your (old) Codestar swag!\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eProgramme:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e* 17.00 walk in\u003cbr/\u003e* 18.00 pizza and Hamza's talk\u003cbr/\u003e* 18.30 board games and drinks\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003ePlease note: This reunion is ONLY for current and former Codestar colleagues.

In this presentation, I will show you how easy it is to create, version, share, and publish Helm Charts. So, start using Helm and stop the copy-and-pasting. Along the way, you will discover the real benefits that lay in the role it plays in streamlining your CI/CD pipelines. Helm automatically maintains a database of all the versions of your releases. So, whenever something goes wrong during deployment, rolling back to the previous version is just one command away.

We delve into concepts such as CPU threads, virtual threads, and structured concurrency, making them accessible to listeners of all proficiency levels.
