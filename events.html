While you acknowledge the value of automated testing, you also recognise that not all tests can be automated due to their complexity or cost. Additionally, you have noticed that pre-conceived tests are not always comprehensive enough to identify unforeseen issues that arise in production.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You may wonder how it&#x27;s possible to include unforeseen issues in pre-conceived tests. And that&#x27;s where this workshop comes in! We will introduce you to Session Based Testing, which can help you become more creative and identify potential issues before they cause problems in production. The workshop will teach you the principles of Exploratory Testing using heuristics, mnemonics, and tours. You will also learn how to apply focus to your testing efforts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the end of the workshop, you will receive cheat sheets and charter ideas to help you implement Exploratory Testing within your organisation and improve the quality of your software. Together, we will explore how to use this approach to identify and address potential issues, even those that may not have been considered in advance.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Key Learnings:&lt;br/&gt;\* What is Exploratory Testing&lt;br/&gt;\* How you can use ET in your day to day practice&lt;br/&gt;\* Helpful cheatsheets and templates&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don&#x27;t forget to bring your laptop as it will be a hands on workshop!

So let&#x27;s start incorporating costs into our cloud design to make the best performance solution and the most economical solution!&lt;br/&gt;In 2022 we see that security by design is common sense, why not incorporate the financial aspect.&lt;br/&gt;In this session we will share our thoughts on maintaining grip on your cloud bill &amp;amp; maintaining high performance. By incorporating our four pillars of economic cloud design you are able to design cost efficient and high performant cloud solutions.&lt;br/&gt;We will of course also explain &quot;Zero User Costs&quot; and &quot;Geo Efficiency&quot; so you can start today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Sebastiaan Zeeff - Get Started With Security: An introduction for developers**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most developers will agree that security is an important consideration in modern software development projects. At the same time, most developers don’t consider themselves to be security experts. While most of us are doing our best, it’s difficult to know what we’re missing or what our blindspots are. Luckily enough, you don’t have to be a security expert to follow a systematic approach to security.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this talk, I will introduce you to the OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model, a comprehensive framework that you can use to assess the maturity of your current approach to security. It also provides you with clear steps that you can take to improve your approach to security. My main focus will be on the dimensions in the model that are directly relevant to developers and I will give you a few examples of practices that you can start implementing today!&lt;/p&gt; </p></section><section><h2>Style your React apps without stress!</h2><p>&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, dynamic styling has always been a controversial topic for many JavaScript/Frontend developers. CSS Custom properties have given us many ways to improve this, however how would it feel to have the full versatile power of a programming language within CSS? With Styled components this is now possible within the React ecosystem and in this video series I will introduce the main concepts to get started. I will cover:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1. Setting up styled components&lt;br/&gt;2. Converting traditional CSS in Styled Components.&lt;br/&gt;3. Set up Theming with Typescript.&lt;br/&gt;4. Adding global styles&lt;br/&gt;5. Extending styles and more…&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you have ever worries how to so custom SaaS styling or how to easily implement a dark mode, this meetup is for you! We will dive in the How and why we would use Styled Components. It’s an OPTIONAL code-along workshop with ample opportunities to ask for questions and best practises. Within 2 hours we will cover the goals listed above and once you leave the room, you will be able to setup and use Styled Components in your own projects. that’s a promise! Who is Rodney Wormsbecher&lt;br/&gt;Rodney is a senior frontend developer who’s been involved in numerous big and small web projects within the Netherlands. Over the past 3 years he has used Styled Components extensively for frontend applications and style libraries.

Important tools for ProRail Traffic Control for control of non-centrally served areas and the port railway line. Shunting and Stabling became an important theme for traffic control in the early years. &#x27;Feniks&#x27; will play an important role in this.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this session Peter likes to talk about his adventures, mainly with Angular and NgRx, and the lessons he learned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Important topics to be covered about Angular are: Project structure, design principles, State management (NgRx 15), Standalone components and Signals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Twan Koot / Michiel Hamers - Design for costs, four pillars of economic Cloud design**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Developers are being exposed to things like FinOps or a massive Azure bill.

Not only the execution time is increasing but also the amount of work to figure out what line of code is causing the issue. Not even to mention the time, money, and complexity it takes to create and maintain a representative test environment containing the right versions of the microservices at the right time for the test.&lt;/p&gt; </p></section><section><h2>Azure Static Web Apps - From Zero to Deployed App In 60 Minutes</h2><p>&lt;p&gt;We&#x27;re very happy to host this talk by Stacy Cashmore. Whether you&#x27;re a front-end developer that wants to tip their toes in Blazor or a back-end developer looking for a way to easily create web applications, this talk is for you!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**About the talk**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;We&#x27;re told that by using services such as Medium, dev.to etc. we are diluting our personal brand. That we should be posting to our own site and building ourselves up. You can, of course, use off-the-shelf applications to do that for you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Or… You can use it as an exercise to try something new and learn new skills!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this session, we will look at doing just that! Starting with an empty GitHub repository we are going to make a Blazor WebAssembly application to act as our website. We’ll connect that to an Azure Function that reads posts from a CosmosDB to pass to that site. Then we’ll deploy that to a production Azure Static Web App.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Of course, when developing an application, it’s useful to be able to run it locally. So, we’ll also look at how we can do that with Azure Static Web Apps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Finally, in order to be able to write new blog posts, we need to be able to authenticate ourselves and provide proper authorization so that this functionality can be added later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**About Stacy**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Speaker, author, and software developer. Stacy has been developing solutions since the mid-1990s in various companies and industries ranging from facilitating contract jobbing to allowing consumers to close a mortgage without the help of a financial adviser – with lots in between.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;She has a passion for sharing knowledge: using storytelling for sharing her experiences to help teams grow in the ways that they develop software and work together and performing live coding demonstrations to inspire others to try new technologies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Stacy has just published her first book, aimed at helping developers get started building dynamic applications using C#, Azure Functions, and Azure Static Web Apps.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For her effort in the community, Stacy has been awarded the Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies since 2020.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;**Programme**&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;17:30 Walk in&lt;br/&gt;18:00 Dinner&lt;br/&gt;18:45 Talk part 1&lt;br/&gt;19:25 Break&lt;br/&gt;19:40 Talk part 2 + Q&amp;amp;A&lt;br/&gt;20:20 Drinks&lt;/p&gt; </p></section></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"pastMeetups":[{"created":1681909979000,"duration":12600000,"id":"292995726","name":"AI Hackathon","date_in_series_pattern":false,"status":"past","time":1688052600000,"local_date":"2023-06-29","local_time":"17:30","updated":1688072986000,"utc_offset":7200000,"waitlist_count":0,"yes_rsvp_count":4,"venue":{"id":24315864,"name":"Ordina HQ ","lat":52.05641174316406,"lon":5.110540866851807,"repinned":true,"address_1":"Ringwade 1","city":"Nieuwegein","country":"nl","localized_country_name":"Netherlands"},"is_online_event":false,"eventType":"PHYSICAL","group":{"created":1465915067000,"name":"Codestar Night","id":20072875,"join_mode":"open","lat":52.099998474121094,"lon":5.110000133514404,"urlname":"Codestar-Night","who":"Codestars","localized_location":"Utrecht, Netherlands","state":"","country":"nl","region":"en_US","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"link":"https://www.meetup.com/codestar-night/events/292995726/","description":"\u003cp\u003e**AI Hackathon,** by Ordina's Frontend Guild\u003cbr/\u003e\"Attention developers and all AI enthusiasts!
